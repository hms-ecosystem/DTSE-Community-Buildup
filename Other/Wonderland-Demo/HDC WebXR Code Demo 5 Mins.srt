Hello everyone! My name is Wei Chung from Futurewei Technologies.

2
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:16,783
Today we’re going to go over what the Wonderland Engine is, its main features,

3
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:22,122
and an introduction to how to build your own VR experience using the Wonderland Engine.

4
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:29,496
From this video, you will learn how to set up your development environment, the different part of the Wonderland Editor UI,

5
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:36,736
Getting started with a new VR project, and adding in objects, applying Javascript components to your objects

6
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:46,479
modify the Scene view, apply Javascript logic to the scene, and lastly, how to debug a game from the Huawei VR Glass

7
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:56,389
The Wonderland Engine is a development platform for web-based graphic applications, specifically for VR and AR.

8
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:07,434
It comes with an accessible 3D editor application, the Wonderland Editor and efficient Webassembly runtime that runs in the browser.

9
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:17,243
The Wonderland engine enables you to easily build
highly performant VR and AR applications for the web.

10
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:24,217
Before we can begin creating a new Wonderland project, please use the QR code or URL to create an account.

11
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:26,719
Download and install Wonderland Engine

12
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:32,425
The Wonderland Editor is only for making
changes to the 3D environment.

13
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:36,329
A separate code editor is needed to edit
the JavaScript files

14
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:39,566
and we recommend
using Visual Studio Code for this.

15
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:46,172
You can follow the QR code or URL to download it.

16
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:49,909
In addition to a code editor,
you're going to need a full

17
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:54,247
VR browser app to run the game on
your Huawei phone.

18
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:59,786
The Wolvic VR browser is the only VR capable
browser created for the Huawei VR Glass.

19
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:06,426
Please download Wolvic VR Browser 6DoF version
from wolvic.com/dl

20
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:14,767
Before moving on to the next step, let me introduce you to Bryant and he will explain the code development.

21
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:18,638
Hello, everyone. I'm Bryant from Futurewei Technologies.

22
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:21,207
Here's what the layout for the Wonderland
Editor looks like,

23
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,743
which is similar to a streamlined 3D
model editor.

24
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,779
The scene view displays
a preview of the 3D environment.

25
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:30,116
All objects can be viewed
and managed from the Scene Outline.

26
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,253
That Asset Browser allows for drag-and-drop.

27
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:35,455
Importation of assets into the project.

28
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:39,092
Individual object properties
can be changed from the Properties view.

29
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:48,468
The Console can be viewed from the bottom right for debugging. You can package and start your game server or from the top center of the window.

30
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:54,607
Now that we've got all the tools installed and our environment setup, let's create
a new Wonderland project.

31
00:02:55,308 --> 00:03:02,849
From the Welcome Screen, Select New > VR template and Create to open up a new project.

32
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:06,519
We start the project off
by importing all the 3D models needed.

33
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:11,791
This can be done by first dragging and dropping the files directly into the model folder of the Asset Browser,

34
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:15,328
and then dropping them
into the scene view.

35
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:21,434
If you need to remove an object from the scene, right-click it from the Scene Outline and select the Delete option.

36
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:25,672
It will still be available in the Asset Browser.

37
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:29,576
Object transformation can be done
from either the Scene or Properties views.

38
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:34,347
Modifications made from the scene view are best for coarse changes

39
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:37,283
while the Properties view
allows for greater precision changes.

40
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:41,487
Additionally, the Properties view
can be used to change JS component values.

41
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:47,427
The Properties view not only allows for changing the values
for JS components,

42
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:53,166
but components can also be added
to objects from this view as well.

43
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:58,338
To remove JS components from an object,
click the three-dot icon and select the delete option.

44
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:05,345
To change the camera view of a scene, we can zoom using the scroll wheel pan by

45
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:10,516
right-clicking and dragging, or rotate by holding the middle mouse button and dragging.

46
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:15,421
To apply JavaScript to our Wonderland project,

47
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:21,094
we need to use a separate code editor like Visual Studio Code to make the actual code changes.

48
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:25,632
The JavaScript defines the behavior
of individual objects such as movement,

49
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:31,304
objects spawning, adding or removing
components, collision effects, etc..

50
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:35,842
When using the Huawei VR class,
it is not possible to connect the phone

51
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:41,781
via USB and debug the Wonderland game while it is running on the device.

52
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:48,554
This is because there is no available
USB port on the phone as it is taken up by the VR glass.

53
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:53,626
Instead, we have to use ADB over Wi-Fi
to connect to the Huawei phone

54
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:59,198
This can be done by enabling ADB
over a Wi-Fi on the Huawei phone,

55
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:07,774
configuring the SSL server on the Wonderland Editor and using localhost:8081 instead of localhost:8080

56
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:11,444
to connect to the Wonderland local server.

57
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:17,417
You can follow the guide
to set up your development environment.

58
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:22,088
That conclude our presentation
on the Wonderland Engine demo.

59
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:26,159
Here are the links for the free
and complete game source code.

60
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:32,231
The Wonderland Engine itself, the Wolvic
VR Browser and check out our website

61
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:34,367
running a live instance of the game.

62
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,836
Thank you.
